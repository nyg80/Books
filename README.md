**The 4-Hour Workweek** by Tim Ferriss

I first read this book while I was still in high school.  I think there are good and bad aspects to it.  The good being that I found it very motivational, and it gave me lots of ambition and drive to succeed.  It also taught me that I can travel a lot and still have a solid, thriving career.  The bad being that it made me think there are shortcuts to success, by working "smart" instead of hard.  Fortunately, I think the book So Good They Can't Ignore You was a good counter argument.  I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't realize that they don't NEED to work an ordinary 9 to 5 job.  It was certainly my first introduction to the concept of lifestyle design.

**Bootstrap: Starting a Successful Company from Scratch** by Ken Hess

I first found this book after coming across (probably via HN) Ken's page on company valuation and return here: http://www.klhess.com/sef_spch.html  I like how Ken shared the business, personal, and family ramifications of the actions that he took in building up Banner Blue Software.  One thing I wish he discussed more was the market evaluation mistakes he made in attempting his product development after already establishing OrgChart.  This is not a must read for people wanting to be entrepreneurs, but it does put a nice (personal) story behind the steps involved in growing a software company.

**So Good They Can't Ignore You** by Cal Newport

I read this book based on its recommendation by Derek Sivers.  I like the concepts Cal presented, particularly the section on the 'craftsman mindset.'  To me, this book was essentially the opposite of the 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss, and I kind of wish I had came across this one first.  I will definitely revisit parts of this book when I am feeling impatient with my current standings in my career, or I need a good kick-in-the-butt to start working hard again on learning new and useful things in my personal time.  I would recommend this book to anyone unhappy with their job, or seeking career advice.  I don't think reading beyond chapter 12 or 13 is necessary though, as the author rehashes all of his points while showing how they apply to himself.  That part might be useful if you are bad at picking up concepts, or you want to become a CS professor yourself.

**How To Get Rich** by Felix Dennis

A surprisingly good book, very well-written.  Again, I picked this up based off of Derek Sivers' recommendation for it.  I like the frank advice on management and negotiations.  Felix is completely honest in his writing, and it shows.  For anyone trying to become an entrepreneur, I would recommend reading this book.  It has useful information about ownership, talent acquisition, growth, and management, and how to handle wealth should you be successful.

**The Personal MBA** by Josh Kaufman

Not as helpful as I expected it to be.  Again, I picked this up after seeing it on sivers.org/book.  It was good in that it gave me some business vocabulary that I was previously unfamiliar with.  Also, the author talked about some subjects in such different terms than what I was used to, that it helped me to see some new ways of looking at business concepts.  The section on working with yourself I skipped almost completely over.  It seemed like it was mostly summaries of various other self-help and pop-psychology books that I've already seen plenty of.

**Confessions of an Economic Hitman** by John Perkins

This book taught me more (in practical terms) about U.S. foreign policy than a lot of my classes ever did.  It also further strengthens my desire to work in a small startup company rather than a huge multinational corporation.  Very eye-opening, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know why the United States is involved in so many foreign conflicts.

**Bursts: The Hidden Patterns Behind Everything We Do** by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi

I got a third of the way through this book before I gave up on it.  To me it couldn't decide if it was trying to be a history book or a science book.  I was particularly frustrated at how the author described how Poisson developed a method of knowing whether something is truly random, but never even explicitly stated Poisson's formula.  Maybe he lays it out later on in the book, but I didn't want to stick around to find out.

**The Power Of Now** by Eckhart Tolle

I used to read the first chapter of this book from time to time to help handle anxiety I was feeling.  I decided to read the whole thing and check out what else Tolle has to say about mindfulness and presence.  I must say that this book certainly changed my mindset on things in life and has helped me to see the positive in everything.  I no longer dwell on painful thoughts and instead am more effective in what I work on.
